## Contributing

This is a community driven list.
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this repo, but we need to be selective about what roles to list. We dont need to have like 5 Nginx roles listed. Only the really top ones. Quality over Quantity.

Some guidelines to be considered to measure the role quality:

- Popularity on GitHub (stars, forks), if applicable.
- Configuration / Variables options.
- Good Documentation.
- Compatible with multiple OS (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS).
- Good personal experience of using the role in production systems.
- Tests

If you know some role who meets these criteria, please feel free to do a PR.
Also I am looking for maintainers to help me with this repo. So if you have some experience with Ansible and want to help, feel free to contact me.
