## Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this repo, but we need to be selective about what roles to list. We dont need to have like 5 Nginx roles listed. Only the really best should be listed. Quality over Quantity.

When adding a new Ansible role, please analyse the following factors, which might help to identify a good role:

- Popularity on GitHub (stars, forks), or Ansible Galaxy.
- Recently updated.
- Configuration options (variables)
- Good Documentation.
- Compatible with multiple OS (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS). If it only works in some systems, that should be clearly indicated.
- Tests

If you know any role who meets these criteria, please feel free to do a PR.
Also I am looking for maintainers to help me with this repo. So if you have some experience with Ansible and want to help, feel free to contact me.

I have done some initial research to add the initial set of roles to this repo. I have not been able to test all of them. If you think some role listed doesnt meet the quality standards for this list and/or you know a better role, please open an issue / PR to change that.

Lets work together to keep this Awesome list, Awesome :)
