# Awesome-Ansible-Roles

A collaborative curated list of awesome Ansible roles.
Ansible is really great but unfortunately its not easy to find top quality modules. Ansible galaxy is really limited compared for example with Puppet Forge for Puppet.

The idea of this repo is to fight that, and make a high quality list of ansible roles, curated by the community.
